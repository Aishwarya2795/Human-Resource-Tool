Statement of the Goal:
The goal of this project is to work collaboratively in an agile environment. At the end of this
project/semester, we expect to create a HR tool – a recommender system – that can possibly categorize employees’
risk of leaving. This can help the internal structure of the company to assess the risk of talented people leaving.
Additionally, we expect to create a system to identify average salary of an employee with suitable attributes and
quantify the satisfaction of any employee.

Services to be provided:
The project will consist of two key features: Business Intelligence for Human resources team with data
visualization, and a recommender tool. We will process the data and plot it real time with a web-frame. We plan
to expand the project by building in a recommendation system for HR Managers. This recommender system will
categorize employees that have a risk of leaving the company or can also be used by potential employees to check
if a company is offering them a competitive salary. We can build few other functionalities, if time permits, like
to predict which valuable employees will leave next. Other features will contain a multivariate regression to create
a prediction line of where an employee satisfaction lay upon.

Description of Programming:
We have employed a few machine learning algorithms to learn from sample data to assess different risk
rates from different employees. We will use Python language for the data analysis as well as to build the planned
recommender tool. Our web frame work or a user interface will be from python as well.
We have developed the tool in an agile developmental model – Scrum. Scrum is one of the most popular
Agile methodologies. It is an adaptive, iterative, fast, flexible, and effective methodology designed to deliver
significant value quickly and throughout a project. We have planned 5 sprints (5 phases in developmental
activities spanning one week each – 5 weeks); Scrum ensures transparency in communication and creates an
environment of collective accountability and continuous progress.

Potential Clientele:
This program will target a key demographic within recruiters, staffing agencies and human resource
organizations.

Human Resource Analytics - Report

Introduction:
 "I quit..." - This is the last thing any manager wants to hear from their employees. Employees are the folks who are responsible for company's culture, profit or loss and overall success. Long-term success, a healthy work environment, and high employee retention are all signs of a successful company. However, when a company experiences attrition of employees, that's when we get to know that something's going wrong. Resulting in huge losses for the company - both monetarily as well as losing settled and valuable employees.
